    "Description": "A long table stretches down the center of the `banquethall`. No food is on it, which cause audible whining from some sad and hungry adventurer. You do manage to spy an empty `goblet` at the very far end of the table however. Now if only you had some `wine`. The rooms nearest you are the `kitchen`, `gallery`, `mainfloorfoyer`, `ballroom` and `library`.",
