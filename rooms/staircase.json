    "Description": "The grand `staircase` of the castle traverses the height of the structure. Plush carpet softens your steps. A circling limestone `banister` is smooth and cool to the touch. From here you can clearly see that you have access to the `dungeonlanding`, `basementfoyer`, `mainfloorfoyer`, `secondfloorfoyer`, thirdfloorfoyer`, and `towerfoyer`.",
