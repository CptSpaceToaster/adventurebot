Such crimes include, but are not limited to: crying in front of a rock, stealing, chewing with your mouth open, and minor genocide. The chief elder's `gavel` rests by his seat in the center of the bench. Adjacent rooms are the `warroom`, `oratory`, `solarium`, `throneroom`, and the `secondfloorfoyer`.",
