    "Description": "You are in the magician quarters in the castle.  The last person to have lived here, presumably a magician, must have been a disorganized fellow.  Several 'papers' are scattered across the floor.  On the far wall is a bookshelf with several 'books'.  Next to the bookshelf is a locked storage locker.  The 'lock' looks quite rusty.",
