A `textbook` which fell on you, a `comic` about unicorns and monster trucks, and a `spellbook` all distract you for a moment before you put them back. You'd stay but then you might get labelled a nerd and you _cannot_ have that sort of a reputation. Around you is a `kitchen`, `gallery`, `mainfloorfoyer`, `ballroom`, and a `banquethall`.",
