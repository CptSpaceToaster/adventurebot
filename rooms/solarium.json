    "Description": "All round you is light. Some pours in unadulterated while some is send through lenses and prisms. As time goes on the light shifts, and the feel of the room shifts with it. During the day bright beams cascade, intermitten with rainbows. At night the room changes, the prisms and lenses align to capture the light emanating from the moon and stars and casts a silvery aura about the room. In the center of the room is a pedastal holding the master `prism`, which gathers all the light into itself on the solstice. Truly higher thought reigns in this room. Close to you is the `oratory`, `throneroom`, `warroom`, `councilofelders`, and the `secondfloorfoyer`.",
