    "Description": "You come to the face of a sheer rock wall.  As you muster all of the geography you learned long ago, you figure this is some sort of bay for two reasons.  1.) The beach appears to be surrounded by a protective rock barrier, and 2.) The remains of an shipwreck are strewn about the shore. (Which is starting to make it look like a terrible place to park the ship)  An odd smell appears to come from the ship's `Cabin`... or what's left of it.  The beach extends to the `South`, and there is a large grassy field to the `East`",
