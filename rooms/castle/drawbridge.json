    "Description": "You appear to be on a `drawbridge`. It looks to be made of oak or cedar or some other wood. You never paid enough attention in arborology in high school anyway. Massive chains connect the bridge to the parapets of the towering structure before you. A large `plaque` is on outside castle wall. To the `North` is a `Large Grassy Field`. In front of you is the `Castle`. At your feet you see a clich√© `welcome mat`.",
