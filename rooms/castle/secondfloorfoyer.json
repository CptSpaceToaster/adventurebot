    "Description": "The second floor of the castle opens up to you. A massive `chandelier` hangs from the ceiling, sending light through many faceted panes of glass and cascading all around the room. Nearby you can see the `throneroom`, the `councilofelders`, the `oratory`, the `solarium`, and the `warroom`. The `staircase` is behind you.",
